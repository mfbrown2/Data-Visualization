#Final Project: Part One 

## The Story  

## Initial Sketches 

## The Data
[State Cancer Registry](https://www.phaim1.health.pa.gov/EDD/WebForms/CancerCntyStMap.aspx)
[Oil and Gas Locations](https://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/DataSummary.aspx?dataset=1088)

## Method and Medium 
For my final project I will be using shorthand to present my work. I am choosing to work with shorthand because the platform allows you to present your narrative in an engaging design.
My plan is to use tableau to create my visualization to present the data. I am choosing Tableau because much of my data will be based on geographical data and this platform allows for the creation of interactive maps.
