# Data-Visualization
## About me
 My name is Meghan Brown and I am a student at Carnegie Mellon University working on my Masters of Science in Public Policy and Management. I also have bachelors degrees in Criminology and Political Science. My educational and professional experiences have led me to pursue a career in which I can work to aid our most vulnerable populations through effective policy decisions. I have a passion for utilizing data analytics to support decision-making and solve complex problems. 
  I am a lover of the arts, and in my free time I enjoy consuming and creating art. Data visualization is at the intersection of two of my passions: data analytics and art. I am enthusiastic about strengthening my skill set and knowledge of the field. 
## What I hope to learn 
 In recent years there has been an enormous growth in data. However, with the raw data it is also essential that were are able to derive meaning from these complex datasets. Data visualization allows for a diverse audience to quickly understand the trends, relationships, and severity of information. Through my Telling Stories with Data course at Carnegie Mellon I hope to be exposed to new platforms and techniques for data visualization.
