V. Current Study and What Needs to be Done 

IV. Call to Action 

## Summary 
Ewing's sarcoma is a type of cancer that forms in an individuals’ bone or soft tissue. According to the Bone Cancer Research Trust (BCRT), the most common symptoms are: localized pain, swelling, and sporadic bone pain with variable intensity. This cancer occurs when there is a genetic change between an individuals’ eleventh and twenty-second chromosomes. However, the cause of Ewing's sarcoma is unknown. The disease impacts about one in a million people per year in the United States.
Despite the rarity of the disease, many young individuals have fallen victim to ewing sarcoma in Southwestern Pennsylvania. In the past ten years, there have been 27 cases of Ewing sarcoma in Washington, Westmoreland, Fayette and Greene counties.
The region has an extensive history with the coal industry, industrial farming chemicals, and even an abandoned uranium disposal site. There have been almost two-thousand deep shale gas wells fracked in Washington County, the most of any county in the state. In addition, the district also houses a former radium and uranium plant in Canonsburg. At the old Standard Chemical Company site, there has been more than 200,000 tons of contaminated waste buried.
The American Cancer Society says there are “no known lifestyle-related or environmental causes” of Ewing. However, the high incidents of this rare cancer have residents of the area demanding answers. Many in the area believe they are living in a cancer cluster and the shale gas industry is to blame.

## Project Structure
 The structure of my project will focus on two main sources of data. The project will begin with an explanation on fracking in Pennsylvania. Then I will use State Cancer data to illustrate the prevalence of cancer in the state. I want to make sure that I am simply presenting facts in my project and allowing the reader to make any connections. There is no proven environmental link to Ewing Sarcoma and I do not want my readers to come away with a wrong impression. My call to action is simply that more reasearch needs to be done to understand the impact that fracking is having on the health of PA residents. 
## Data Sources
 [Oil and Gas sites in Pennsylvania](/finalpart2.md)
 
 [Pennsylvania State Cancer Data](/finalpart2.md)
 
 Both of these data sources are critical to my project. First I will obtain information on fracking in the state on Pennsylvania through the Department of Environmental Protection. This dataset contains the latitude and longitude for all sites and 
 
 The Pennsylvania State Cancer Data set is a robust data set that breaksdown the occurences of cancer by county. The limitation of this dataset is that the cancer inncidents can only be broken down into 23 main cancer types. Due to this my graphs depict bone cancer generally rather than the specific form.One major limitation of my project is the lack of dataset that incapsulates the inncidents of Ewing Sarcoma specifically. 

## Method and Medium 

In order to complete my data visulalization I am using Tableau desktop. For my final project I will be using shorthand to present my work. I am choosing to work with shorthand because the platform allows you to present your narrative in an engaging design. My plan is to use tableau to create my visualization to present the data. I am choosing Tableau because much of my data will be based on geographical data and this platform allows for the creation of interactive maps.
